You will need to have pip and python 3 installed to run these commands. For a quick setup, run all the specified commands to create a virtual python environment with all required packages and after the final command `flask run` the Flask server will start. If the React server (https://github.com/Christian-Gebhardt/classifier-evaluation-framework-webapp) is already running you are ready to send requests and use the framework. For more information regarding usage see my bachelor thesis 'Entwicklung eines webbasierten Rahmenwerkes zur Evaluation von Klassifikatoren'. Also when you encounter problems, you can send me an email at christian.gebhardt@uni-bayreuth.de.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pip install pipenv`

Installs virtual python environment. Then run

### `pipenv install`

Installs all required packages. After that run

### `pipenv shell`

Activates virtual python environment. Finally you can run

### `flask run`

Runs the development server. After that you can start the React Server and you should be able to make requests.
Make sure the virtual python environment is selected as python interpreter.
